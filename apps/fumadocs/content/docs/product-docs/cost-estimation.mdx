## Revenue Projections

### Pricing Model

Define your pricing strategy:

| Plan | Price/Month | Features | Target Users |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Free | {`$0`} | Basic features | Early adopters |
| Starter | {`$10`} | Standard features | Individual users |
| Pro | {`$30`} | Advanced features | Power users |
| Enterprise | {`$100`} and up | Custom features | Teams |

### Break-Even Analysis

Calculate when you'll break even:

**Monthly Costs**: $X (from operational costs above)
**Average Revenue per User (ARPU)**: $X
**Break-Even Users**: Monthly Costs ÷ ARPU = X users

### Growth Projections

| Month | Users | MRR | Costs | Profit/Loss |
|-------|-------|-----|-------|-------------|
| 1 | 10 | {`$100`} | {`$90`} | +{`$10`} |
| 3 | 50 | {`$500`} | {`$120`} | +{`$380`} |
| 6 | 200 | {`$2`},000 | {`$200`} | +{`$1`},800 |
| 12 | 500 | {`$5`},000 | {`$350`} | +{`$4`},650 |

## Cost Optimization Tips

### Reduce Costs

1. **Start with free tiers** - All services offer generous free plans
2. **Delay premium features** - Don't upgrade until you need it
3. **Optimize API calls** - Cache data to reduce Convex reads
4. **Batch operations** - Reduce number of database operations
5. **Monitor usage** - Set up alerts before hitting limits

### When to Upgrade

Upgrade services when:
- You consistently hit free tier limits
- You need better support
- You require advanced features
- Your revenue supports the cost

## Payment Processing Fees

### Polar.sh Fees

- **Percentage**: 4% of transaction amount
- **Per Transaction**: {`$0.40`} per transaction
- **Example**: {`$10`} subscription = {`$0.40`} (4%) + {`$0.40`} (transaction) = {`$0.80`} fee = {`$9.20`} net
- **Volume discounts**: May be available at higher volumes

### Stripe (via Polar)

- **Credit cards**: 2.9% + {`$0.30`}
- **Polar fees**: 4% + {`$0.40`} per transaction
- **Total fees**: ~6.9% + {`$0.70`} per transaction
- **Example**: {`$10`} transaction = {`$0.29`} (Stripe) + {`$0.40`} (Polar %) + {`$0.40`} (Polar tx) = {`$1.09`} in fees = {`$8.91`} net

### UseAutumn (Direct Stripe Integration)

- **Stripe fees**: 2.9% + {`$0.30`} per transaction
- **UseAutumn platform**: Free up to {`$8`}K/month revenue, then {`$375`}/month up to {`$50`}K
- **Total transaction fees**: ~2.9% + {`$0.30`} per transaction
- **Example**: {`$10`} transaction = ~{`$0.59`} in Stripe fees = {`$9.41`} net
- **Note**: UseAutumn charges are based on monthly revenue thresholds, not per-transaction fees. You only pay Stripe's processing fees per transaction.
