<Note>
  Ultracite is a zero-config Biome preset designed for both humans and LLMs. It's 35x faster than ESLint and Prettier combined.
</Note>

Ultracite provides AI-ready formatting and linting rules through Biome. This boilerplate comes pre-configured with Ultracite presets for core JavaScript/TypeScript and React code.

## What is Ultracite?

Ultracite is a curated set of Biome presets that:
- Enforces consistent code style across your codebase
- Provides rules optimized for both human readability and LLM understanding
- Runs 35x faster than traditional ESLint + Prettier setups
- Works seamlessly with AI coding assistants

## Configuration

Ultracite is configured in `biome.json` at the root of your project:

```json
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/@biomejs/biome/configuration_schema.json",
  "files": {
    "ignoreUnknown": false,
    "includes": [
      "**",
      "!**/.next",
      "!**/dist",
      "!**/.turbo",
      "!**/dev-dist",
      "!**/.zed",
      "!**/.vscode",
      "!**/routeTree.gen.ts",
      "!**/src-tauri",
      "!**/.nuxt",
      "!bts.jsonc",
      "!**/.expo",
      "!**/.wrangler",
      "!**/.alchemy",
      "!**/.svelte-kit",
      "!**/wrangler.jsonc",
      "!**/.source"
    ]
  },
  "extends": [
    "ultracite/core",
    "ultracite/react"
  ]
}
```

The configuration uses two Ultracite presets:
- **`ultracite/core`**: Core JavaScript/TypeScript rules
- **`ultracite/react`**: React-specific rules and best practices

## Usage

### Run Formatting and Linting

Format and lint your entire codebase:

```bash
bun run check
```

This command:
- Checks all files for linting issues
- Auto-fixes issues where possible
- Formats code according to Ultracite rules

### Editor Integration

Most modern editors have Biome support via extensions:

- **VS Code**: Install the [Biome extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome)
- **Cursor**: Biome is built-in
- **Zed**: Biome support via extensions

Once installed, your editor will:
- Show linting errors inline
- Auto-format on save (if configured)
- Provide quick fixes for common issues

### CI/CD Integration

Add a check step to your CI pipeline:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions
- name: Check code formatting
  run: bun run check
```

This ensures all code follows Ultracite rules before merging.

## What Rules Are Enabled?

Ultracite includes hundreds of rules covering:

- **Code Quality**: Enforces best practices and avoids common pitfalls
- **Accessibility**: Ensures your React components are accessible
- **Performance**: Prevents performance anti-patterns
- **Security**: Catches potential security issues
- **React Best Practices**: Follows React 19+ conventions

Key rules include:
- No `any` types
- Proper React hooks usage
- Accessible components
- Consistent code style
- Modern JavaScript patterns

## Customization

While Ultracite works great out of the box, you can extend or override rules in `biome.json`:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "ultracite/core",
    "ultracite/react"
  ],
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true,
      "suspicious": {
        "noExplicitAny": "off"  // Override specific rule
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits for AI Assistants

Ultracite's rules are designed to be:
- **LLM-friendly**: Consistent patterns that AI assistants can learn from
- **Predictable**: Code structure that's easy for AI to understand
- **Documented**: Rules that provide context for AI code generation

When AI assistants read your codebase, they see:
- Consistent formatting patterns
- Clear code structure
- Well-defined conventions

This helps AI assistants generate code that matches your project's style automatically.
