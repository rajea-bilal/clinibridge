Every time you come back to work on a project based off of Yugen, start your development environment as follows:

## 1. Frontend Web Server

In one terminal, run the following command:

```bash
bun run dev
```

This uses TurboRepo TUI to start the web server, Convex backend, and Fumadocs in one go.

Your app will be running at:
- **App**: `http://localhost:3002` (web server)
- **Cloudflare Workers**: `http://localhost:3001` (Cloudflare Workers dev server)
- **Docs**: `http://localhost:4000`

## 2. Cloudflare Workers Dev Server

In another terminal, from the **`apps/web/`** directory:

```bash
bun alchemy dev
```

<Note>
  Make sure you're in the `apps/web/` directory (where `alchemy.run.ts` exists).
</Note>

## 3. Webhook Testing

In another terminal, run the following command:

```bash
ngrok http 3002
```

<Note>
  You only need to run ngrok when testing webhooks (payments only). Use port 3002 (web server), not 3001 (Cloudflare Workers dev server).
</Note>

If you do use ngrok, every time you run `ngrok http 3002`, it will generate a new URL so you need to update these locations:

1. **Local Environment** (`.env.convex.dev`, `packages/backend/.env.local`, `apps/web/.env.local`):
   ```bash
   SITE_URL=https://new-ngrok-url.ngrok.app
   ```

2. **Apply to Convex:**
   ```bash
   bun run setup:convex:dev
   ```

3. **Polar.sh Webhook URL:**
   - Navigate to Polar Dashboard → Settings → Webhooks
   - Update the webhook URL to use your new ngrok URL

4. **Restart Servers:**
   ```bash
   # Stop both servers (Ctrl+C) and restart
   bun run dev  # From root
   bun alchemy dev  # From apps/web/
   ```

<Note>
  You may need to buy an ngrok pro plan because they limit usage for free users.
</Note>


## 4. Build & Deploy

Now you can start building features or fixing bugs.

Once you're done and have tested locally:

```bash
# Deploy to production
bun run deploy
```

This deploys your app to Cloudflare Workers and updates your Convex production environment.
