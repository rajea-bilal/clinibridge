## Why Documentation Matters

In the age of AI, documentation is no longer optional - it's critical. Without it, you lose context, repeat mistakes, and confuse yourself and your Agents as your codebase grows.

**Without docs:**

- ❌ Lose context between sessions

- ❌ Repeat the same mistakes

- ❌ Confuse AI assistants with missing context

- ❌ Struggle to onboard team members

- ❌ Forget why you made decisions

**With good docs:**

- ✅ Better AI assistance (Agents will love this context!)

- ✅ Faster Developer onboarding (if you want to hire in the future)

- ✅ Decision history (easy for you and an Agent to understand why decisions were made)

- ✅ Reduced bugs and rework (easier to debug and understand why things are the way they are)

<Callout type="info">

  **Where Your Documentation Lives** 📁

  - ✅ **Fumadocs already configured** - Your codebase includes a full documentation site powered by Fumadocs

  - ✅ **Runs on port 4000** - When you run `bun run dev`, your docs site will be available at `http://localhost:4000`

  - ✅ **Ready to use** - Navigate to the "Project Documentation" section and start filling in your docs

  - 📂 **Location**: `content/docs/product-docs/` in your codebase

  <Cards>

    <Card

      title="Project Documentation"

      description="All your project documentation will live in your codebase. It's already set up and ready to use."

    />

  </Cards>

</Callout>

The fastest way to create MVP documentation is to work with an AI agent across **6 focused conversations**. Each conversation targets a specific aspect of your product.

<Warning>

  **Important:** Before starting the documentation conversations, you must:

  

  1. **Clone the codebase** - Follow the [Project Setup guide](/docs/setup/1-ramp-up) to clone and set up the project locally

  2. **Open the project in Cursor** - Navigate to your cloned project directory in Cursor IDE

  3. **Start conversations from within the codebase** - This ensures your AI agent has full context of your tech stack, README.md, and project structure

  

  **Note on Documentation Paths:**

  - Prompts reference `content/docs/product-docs/` (already exists in your codebase)

  

  All documentation prompts reference files like `README.md` that exist in your cloned codebase. Without cloning first, the AI agent won't have the necessary context to provide accurate documentation.

</Warning>

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

<Cards>

  <Card

    title="Cursor IDE installed + Pro Subscription"

    href="https://www.cursor.so/"

    description="Ensure you have Cursor IDE and a Pro Subscription so you can use the premium models like GPT-5-High."

  />

  <Card

    title="A Validated Product Idea"

    description="You should an idea that has been validated through our recommended Idea Validation process."

  />

</Cards>

<Cards>

  <Card

    title="Project Setup"

    href="/docs/setup/1-ramp-up"

    description="Clone and set up the project (TanStack Start, Convex, BetterAuth, Polar.sh)"

  />

</Cards>

<Note>

  If you prefer to use Claude Code or another AI agent, feel free to do so. We recommend using Cursor and the GPT-5-High model for the best experience.

</Note>

### The 6-step Documentation Framework

We'll follow a framework to help you document your product and all the important decisions you'll make before building, so you and your AI assistants can execute on your idea.

## 1. Product Idea, Vision & Strategy

**Goal**: Define your product vision, target audience, core features, success metrics, competitive landscape, implementation planning, and any external dependencies you'll need.

**Duration**: `20-25 minutes`

**Model**: `gpt-5-high`

<Note>

  **Start this conversation from within your cloned codebase** so the AI agent has full context of your tech stack and project structure.

</Note>

Open a new Agent tab in Cursor (from within your cloned project directory) and use this prompt:

<Note>

  **Documentation Paths:** The prompts below reference `content/docs/product-docs/` paths which are already set up in your codebase.

</Note>

```markdown

I'm building an MVP and need help documenting my product vision and strategy. 

**IMPORTANT**: Before we start, please:

1. **Check the README.md file** in this codebase to understand my current tech stack

2. **Perform real-time web research** on current pricing, features, and capabilities of my tech stack components

3. **Read the existing Project Documentation → Idea page** (content/docs/product-docs/idea.mdx) to understand what's already documented

4. **Note**: I should have already completed the Target Market & ICP deep dive from the [Idea Validation guide](/docs/company-building/idea-validation). This documentation will expand and formalize that analysis.

**My Product Idea**: [Describe your product idea in 2-3 sentences]

**Current Understanding**: [What you know about your target market, competitors, etc.]

Please help me create documentation for the "Idea" page in my Project Documentation. I want to document:

1. **Problem Statement** - What problem am I solving?

2. **Solution Overview** - How does my product solve it?

3. **Target Audience & ICP Deep Dive** - Deeply identify and understand your target market:

   - **Demographics** - Age, location, occupation, income level, education

   - **Psychographics** - Behaviors, motivations, pain points, goals, fears

   - **Behavioral Patterns** - How they currently solve this problem, what tools they use, daily routines

   - **Pain Intensity** - How urgent is this problem? How much time/money does it cost them?

   - **Willingness to Pay** - Have they paid for similar solutions? What's their budget?

   - **Platform Identification** - Where do your target users spend most of their time online? (LinkedIn, X/Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit, Discord/Slack, Facebook Groups, YouTube, industry-specific forums, etc.)

   - **Distribution Strategy** - Based on platform identification, how will you reach your first 10-100 users? What's your clear plan for finding and engaging with them?

   - **Validation Evidence** - Have you spoken to potential customers? Did someone say "I will pay for this" or show clear payment intent? Document your validation conversations and commitments.

   - **Competitor Analysis** (if cloning an existing app) - Analyze competitor ad strategies, distribution channels, content strategies, and community presence using tools like Rival Sonar (https://www.rival-sonar.com/blog/exploit-gaps-in-competitor-ad-strategy)

4. **B2C vs B2B Classification** - Determine if this should be a B2C (Business-to-Consumer) or B2B (Business-to-Business) app:

   - Analyze the target audience, use case, and product characteristics

   - Consider factors like: individual vs team usage, pricing models, sales cycles, support requirements

   - Recommend the appropriate model and justify the decision

   - **Stack Requirements**: If B2B, identify what needs to be enabled/configured in the current stack:

     - Organization/team management features

     - Multi-tenant architecture considerations

     - Admin/dashboard capabilities for team management

     - SSO (Single Sign-On) or enterprise authentication options

     - Billing/subscription management for teams vs individuals

     - Any additional Convex schema, BetterAuth configurations, or Polar.sh features needed

   - **Cost Implications**: Research and document:

     - Additional costs for B2B features (e.g., SSO pricing in BetterAuth, team management costs)

     - Scaling costs as teams/organizations grow

     - Any premium tier requirements for B2B functionality

     - Comparison of B2C vs B2B pricing tiers for all relevant services

5. **Core Features** - What features do I need for MVP?

6. **Competitive Analysis** - How am I different?

7. **Expected Scale** - How many users do I expect to have?

8. **3rd-party libraries/providers/APIs** - What external libraries/providers/APIs do I need to use (other than what my current tech stack provides)?

9. **Pricing Model Decision** - Subscription vs One-time vs Hybrid (justify with web research and product type)

10. **Implementation Planning** - Development phases, timeline estimation, resource requirements, risk assessment, success metrics, launch strategy

Use this decision framework when selecting the pricing model:

- Recurring Subscriptions

  - Use when you provide ongoing value

  - Examples: SaaS tools used regularly, monitoring services, continuous access platforms

  - Benefits: Predictable revenue, higher LTV, easier to scale

- One-Time Payments

  - Use when value is delivered once

  - Examples: Digital downloads, one-off transformations, limited-time access

  - Benefits: Simpler to manage, no recurring obligations, clear value proposition

- Hybrid Models

  - Combine both payment types

  - Examples: Setup fee + monthly access, one-time purchase + optional subscription support

  - Benefits: Maximizes revenue opportunities, caters to preferences, flexible strategy

- Product Type Considerations

  - Transformation Products → bias to one-time (e.g., fitness apps, course platforms)

  - Utility Products → bias to subscription (e.g., budget trackers, productivity tools)

- Currency & Pricing Psychology

  - Align currencies with target demographics

  - Use psychological pricing (e.g., $29 vs $30)

**Output**: A clear recommendation with rationale and sources. Also note downstream impacts on database schema, pricing page UX, and payments provider configuration.

Make sure to include the following sections in Project Documentation → Idea (content/docs/product-docs/idea.mdx):

**Target Audience & ICP Deep Dive**

- Demographics: [Detailed breakdown]

- Psychographics: [Behaviors, motivations, pain points]

- Behavioral Patterns: [How they currently solve the problem]

- Pain Intensity: [Urgency and cost of the problem]

- Willingness to Pay: [Payment history and budget]

- Platform Identification: [Where they spend time online - specific platforms]

- Distribution Strategy: [How to reach first 10-100 users on identified platforms]

- Validation Evidence: [Customer conversations and payment commitments]

- Competitor Analysis: [If cloning, competitor ad/distribution/content analysis]

**B2C vs B2B Classification**

- Classification: [B2C | B2B | Hybrid]

- Rationale: [2-4 bullets explaining why this classification fits the product]

- Stack Requirements: [What needs to be enabled/configured in the current stack, if B2B]

- Cost Implications: [Additional costs, premium tiers, scaling costs for B2B features]

- Schema Impact: [Notes on how this affects database design - organizations/teams tables, user-organization relationships, etc.]

**Pricing Model Decision**

- Decision: [Subscription | One-time | Hybrid]

- Rationale: [2-4 bullets citing product type and web research]

- Product Type: [Transformation | Utility | Mixed]

- Currency & Pricing: [Primary currency and psychological price points]

- Database Impact: [Keep/remove: subscriptions tables, one-time payments tables, and invoice fields?]

- Provider/Webhooks: [Which flows are needed and why]

These sections must be present in content/docs/product-docs/idea.mdx so downstream docs (architecture, database, payments) can reference them.

**CRITICAL**: When we're done, I need you to **replace the entire content** of the Project Documentation → Idea page (content/docs/product-docs/idea.mdx) with our final documentation, not just provide text to copy.

Before you do that, please ask me clarifying questions and help me think through each area thoroughly. Use real-time web research to ensure accuracy of current market conditions, competitor pricing, and tech stack capabilities.

Before you do that, please ask me clarifying questions and help me think through each area thoroughly. Use real-time web research to ensure accuracy of current UX best practices, product type, and user behavior patterns.

```

## Next Steps

After completing all 6 conversations:

1. **Review all documentation** - Ensure consistency across sections

2. **Share with stakeholders** - Get feedback on your plan (from your team, or a client - if you have one)

<Note>
