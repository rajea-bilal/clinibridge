# AI Agent Skills Activation

Guidelines for making AI agent skills activate reliably based on research showing 84% success vs 20% baseline.

## The Problem

Claude Code skills activate ~20% of the time by default with simple instruction hooks. Skills are passive suggestions that get ignored.

## The Solution: Commitment Mechanisms

Simple hooks are passive suggestions Claude ignores. The fix: make Claude explicitly evaluate EACH skill with YES/NO reasoning before proceeding.

Once Claude writes "YES - need reactive state" → it's committed to using that skill.

## Forced Evaluation Pattern (84% Success Rate)

Use aggressive language ("MANDATORY", "WORTHLESS", "CRITICAL") and a 3-step process:

### Step 1 - EVALUATE
State YES/NO with reason for each skill

### Step 2 - ACTIVATE  
Use Skill() NOW

### Step 3 - IMPLEMENT
Only after activation

```
CRITICAL: The evaluation is WORTHLESS unless you ACTIVATE the skills.
```

## Key Insights

- Multi-skill prompts killed simple hooks completely (0% success)
- The forced eval hook never failed a category
- Commitment mechanism creates accountability
- Verbose output (listing all skills with YES/NO reasoning) is worth the trade-off

## Hook Types Performance

| Hook Type | Pass Rate | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| No hook | ~0% | Baseline, skills ignored |
| Simple instruction | 20% | Passive, easily ignored |
| Forced eval | 84% | Most consistent |
| LLM eval | 80% | Cheaper but can fail spectacularly |

## When to Use

- **Forced eval**: Most consistent, no external dependencies, verbose but reliable
- **LLM eval**: Cheaper/faster, but can completely miss certain prompts
- **Simple instruction**: Avoid - too unreliable

## Implementation

For complex tasks requiring multiple skills:

1. List all available skills explicitly
2. Require YES/NO evaluation with reasoning for each
3. Mandate activation before implementation
4. Use strong language to enforce compliance
